            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for 
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the 
            meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies 
            such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
            JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
             storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes 
             the structure of a 
             web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. 
            In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
             In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
